Command for execution

a) Change directory to project directory.
b) execute
    node dq_cli.js -src <suite_xlsx_without_extn>


Advantages of templates
1) During auto-creation of templates, should take care of appending double quotes wherever file path related attributes are present in CLI.
    Having a ready template can avoid handling such things in the code.
2) For auto-generation of templates, code will depend on global property file "config.json" and "testsuite.xls". Because global properties like domain name, user  name, domain are not entered in testsuite.xls as they are common and thus entered in config.json. So code has to be modified.
3) User can create template by looking at cli help plugin. The placeholder names for command argument options can be anything, but just need to make sure that same names should be entered in testSuite.xml. So user is expected to write template first and then testSuite. User has a full-freedom of choosing the names for the placeholder.
Example:
mrs createproject -dn <<DomainName>> -un <<UserName>> -pd <<Password>> -sdn <<SecurityDomain>> -sn <<ServiceName>> -pn <<ProjectName>>
above command can be written as-
mrs createproject -dn <<Domain_name>> -un <<User>> -pd <<Pwd>> -sdn <<SecurityDomain>> -sn <<MRS_ServiceName>> -pn <<ProjectName>>
(This might be helpful if user wants to have customized name in is Excel)

Program features:
a) Population of argument values for command creation.
	1) First it will replace few argument values in template with CLI execution specific parameters generated by program.
	2) Then it will replace few global properties in template with global property file config.json
	3) Later it will replace all remaining elements by taking values from testsuite.xls
              	[This flow is very helpful if you want to over-ride UserName and Password for each commands with different user accounts other than the                             one mentioned in global property file config.json.
b) Directly communicates with QA Track Server (without java intervention) to get QA Track URL. So no need of having JVM.


c)Takes backup of old executable batch/script CLI files
d)Takes backup of old log files

e)User friendly TestSuite to plugin inputs

Driven by Template (Need to have different templates for commands with varieties of optional arguments)

Driven by Excel (Hard-coded column names - Cannot be renamed)
